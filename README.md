"Execute in proper id for better execution"


Disclaimer :

* Linkedin is restricted to provide exact names on random ids.
* With API admin rights, very small script can work.
* Linkedin profiles can be extracted easily via first name and company in Google search,
    but due to multiple "Linkedin" string in first name, Script cannot proceed.
* Thats why I didn't proceed with parallel google search for faster script execution.
* With a valid Fisrtname and Company name : Another script could be attach to fill user profiles in very less execution time.
